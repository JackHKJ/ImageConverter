This is an application for automatically converting images(in nested folders) into desired format
Output may be adjusted in config.txt：
The first line indicates the name of the output folder (starting from current working directory, default: $Converted  
The second line indicates the output format, which could be: webp, jpeg, png ; default: png
When config.txt is not provided or mistyped, then the default setting will be applied
This app will automatically skip images within the output directory, and may continue working from last job(if killed)

You can copy the following files：
"app.exe" "config.txt" and the folder called "Sample" to any empty folder and execute app.exe to see how it works
